This functionality is in beta and is subject to change. The design and code is
less mature than official GA features and is being provided as-is with no
warranties. Beta features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA
features.

This Helm chart is a lightweight way to configure and run our official
[Elasticsearch Docker image][].


## Requirements

* [Helm][] >=2.8.0 and <3.0.0 (see [parent README][] for more details)
* Kubernetes >=1.8
* Minimum cluster requirements include the following to run this chart with
default settings. All of these settings are configurable.
  * Three Kubernetes nodes to respect the default "hard" affinity settings
  * 1GB of RAM for the JVM heap


## Installing

This chart is tested with the latest 7.7.0-SNAPSHOT versions.

### Using Helm repository

* Add the Elastic Helm charts repo:
`helm repo add elastic https://helm.elastic.co`

* Install the latest 7.7 release:
`helm install --name elasticsearch elastic/elasticsearch --version=7.7.0`

### Using the 7.7 branch

* Clone the git repo and checkout the right branch:

  ```shell
  git clone git@github.com:elastic/helm-charts.git
  cd helm-charts
  git checkout -b 7.7 origin/7.7
  ````

* Install the latest 7.7.0-SNAPSHOT:
`helm install --name elasticsearch ./helm-charts/elasticsearch`


## Upgrading

Please always check [CHANGELOG.md][] and [BREAKING_CHANGES.md][] before
upgrading to a new chart version.


## Usage notes

* This repo includes a number of [examples][] configurations which can be used
as a reference. They are also used in the automated testing of this chart.
* Automated testing of this chart is currently only run against GKE (Google
Kubernetes Engine).
* The chart deploys a StatefulSet and by default will do an automated rolling
update of your cluster. It does this by waiting for the cluster health to become
green after each instance is updated. If you prefer to update manually you can
set `OnDelete` [updateStrategy][].
* It is important to verify that the JVM heap size in `esJavaOpts` and to set
the CPU/Memory `resources` to something suitable for your cluster.
* To simplify chart and maintenance each set of node groups is deployed as a
separate Helm release. Take a look at the [multi][] example to get an idea for
how this works. Without doing this it isn't possible to resize persistent
volumes in a StatefulSet. By setting it up this way it makes it possible to add
more nodes with a new storage size then drain the old ones. It also solves the
problem of allowing the user to determine which node groups to update first when
doing upgrades or changes.
* We have designed this chart to be very un-opinionated about how to configure
Elasticsearch. It exposes ways to set environment variables and mount secrets
inside of the container. Doing this makes it much easier for this chart to
support multiple versions with minimal changes.


## Migration from helm/charts stable

If you currently have a cluster deployed with the [helm/charts stable][] chart
you can follow the [migration guide][].

## Try it out

In [examples][] you will find some example configurations. These examples are
used for the automated testing of this Helm chart.

### Default

To deploy a cluster with all default values and run the integration tests:

```
cd examples/default
make
```

### Multi

A cluster with dedicated node types:

```
cd examples/multi
make
```

### Security

A cluster with node to node security and https enabled. This example uses
autogenerated certificates and password, for a production deployment you want to
generate SSL certificates following the [official docs][node-certificates].

Generate the certificates and install Elasticsearch:

```
cd examples/security
make

# Run a curl command to interact with the cluster
kubectl exec -ti security-master-0 -- sh -c 'curl -u $ELASTIC_USERNAME:$ELASTIC_PASSWORD -k https://localhost:9200/_cluster/health?pretty'
```


## FAQ

### How to install plugins?

The recommended way to install plugins into our Docker images is to create a
[custom Docker image][].

The Dockerfile would look something like:

```
ARG elasticsearch_version
FROM docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:${elasticsearch_version}

RUN bin/elasticsearch-plugin install --batch repository-gcs
```

And then updating the `image` in values to point to your custom image.

There are a couple reasons we recommend this.

1. Tying the availability of Elasticsearch to the download service to install
plugins is not a great idea or something that we recommend. Especially in
Kubernetes where it is normal and expected for a container to be moved to
another host at random times.
2. Mutating the state of a running Docker image (by installing plugins) goes
against best practices of containers and immutable infrastructure.

### How to use the keystore?

#### Basic example

Create the secret, the key name needs to be the keystore key path. In this
example we will create a secret from a file and from a literal string.

```
kubectl create secret generic encryption_key --from-file=xpack.watcher.encryption_key=./watcher_encryption_key
kubectl create secret generic slack_hook --from-literal=xpack.notification.slack.account.monitoring.secure_url='https://hooks.slack.com/services/asdasdasd/asdasdas/asdasd'
```

To add these secrets to the keystore:

```
keystore:
  - secretName: encryption_key
  - secretName: slack_hook
```

#### Multiple keys

All keys in the secret will be added to the keystore. To create the previous
example in one secret you could also do:

```
kubectl create secret generic keystore_secrets --from-file=xpack.watcher.encryption_key=./watcher_encryption_key --from-literal=xpack.notification.slack.account.monitoring.secure_url='https://hooks.slack.com/services/asdasdasd/asdasdas/asdasd'
```

```
keystore:
  - secretName: keystore_secrets
```

#### Custom paths and keys

If you are using these secrets for other applications (besides the Elasticsearch
keystore) then it is also possible to specify the keystore path and which keys
you want to add. Everything specified under each `keystore` item will be passed
through to the `volumeMounts` section for mounting the [secret][]. In this
example we will only add the `slack_hook` key from a secret that also has other
keys. Our secret looks like this:

```
kubectl create secret generic slack_secrets --from-literal=slack_channel='#general' --from-literal=slack_hook='https://hooks.slack.com/services/asdasdasd/asdasdas/asdasd'
```

We only want to add the `slack_hook` key to the keystore at path
`xpack.notification.slack.account.monitoring.secure_url`:

```
keystore:
  - secretName: slack_secrets
    items:
    - key: slack_hook
      path: xpack.notification.slack.account.monitoring.secure_url
```

You can also take a look at the [config example][] which is used as part of the
automated testing pipeline.

### How to enable snapshotting?

1. Install your [snapshot plugin][] into a custom Docker image following the
[how to install plugins guide][].
2. Add any required secrets or credentials into an Elasticsearch keystore
following the [how to use the keystore][] guide.
3. Configure the [snapshot repository][] as you normally would.
4. To automate snapshots you can use a tool like [curator][]. In the future
there are plans to have Elasticsearch manage automated snapshots with
[Snapshot Lifecycle Management][].


## Local development environments

This chart is designed to run on production scale Kubernetes clusters with
multiple nodes, lots of memory and persistent storage. For that reason it can be
a bit tricky to run them against local Kubernetes environments such as minikube.
Below are some examples of how to get this working locally.

### Minikube

This chart also works successfully on [minikube][] in addition to typical hosted
Kubernetes environments. An example `values.yaml` file for minikube is provided
under `examples/`.

In order to properly support the required persistent volume claims for the
Elasticsearch `StatefulSet` , the `default-storageclass` and
`storage-provisioner` minikube addons must be enabled:

```
minikube addons enable default-storageclass
minikube addons enable storage-provisioner
cd examples/minikube
make
```

Note that if `helm` or `kubectl` timeouts occur, you may consider creating a
minikube VM with more CPU cores or memory allocated.

### Docker for Mac - Kubernetes

It is also possible to run this chart with the built in Kubernetes cluster that
comes with [docker-for-mac][]:

```
cd examples/docker-for-mac
make
```

### KIND - Kubernetes

It is also possible to run this chart using a Kubernetes [KIND][] (Kubernetes in
Docker) cluster:

```
cd examples/kubernetes-kind
make
```

### MicroK8S

It is also possible to run this chart using [MicroK8S][]:

```
microk8s.enable dns
microk8s.enable helm
microk8s.enable storage
cd examples/microk8s
make
```


## Clustering and Node Discovery

This chart facilitates Elasticsearch node discovery and services by creating two
`Service` definitions in Kubernetes, one with the name `$clusterName-$nodeGroup`
and another named `$clusterName-$nodeGroup-headless`.
Only `Ready` pods are a part of the `$clusterName-$nodeGroup` service, while all
pods ( `Ready` or not) are a part of `$clusterName-$nodeGroup-headless`.

If your group of master nodes has the default `nodeGroup: master` then you can
just add new groups of nodes with a different `nodeGroup` and they will
automatically discover the correct master. If your master nodes have a different
`nodeGroup` name then you will need to set `masterService` to
`$clusterName-$masterNodeGroup`.

The chart value for `masterService` is used to populate
`discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts` , which Elasticsearch nodes will use to
contact master nodes and form a cluster.
Therefore, to add a group of nodes to an existing cluster, setting
`masterService` to the desired `Service` name of the related cluster is
sufficient.

For an example of deploying both a group master nodes and data nodes using
multiple releases of this chart, see the accompanying values files in
`examples/multi`.
