# Logstash Helm Chart

This functionality is in beta and is subject to change. The design and code is less mature than official GA features and is being provided as-is with no warranties. Beta features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.

This helm chart is a lightweight way to configure and run our official [Logstash docker image](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/docker.html)

## Requirements

* [Helm](https://helm.sh/) >= 2.8.0 (see parent [README](../README.md) for more details)
* Kubernetes >= 1.8

## Usage notes and getting started

* This repo includes a number of [example](./examples) configurations which can be used as a reference. They are also used in the automated testing of this chart
* Automated testing of this chart is currently only run against GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine).
* The chart deploys a statefulset and by default will do an automated rolling update of your cluster. It does this by waiting for the cluster health to become green after each instance is updated. If you prefer to update manually you can set [`updateStrategy: OnDelete`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#on-delete)
* It is important to verify that the JVM heap size in `logstashJavaOpts` and to set the CPU/Memory `resources` to something suitable for your cluster
* We have designed this chart to be very un-opinionated about how to configure Logstash. It exposes ways to set environment variables and mount secrets inside of the container. Doing this makes it much easier for this chart to support multiple versions with minimal changes.
* `logstash.yml` configuration files can be set either by a ConfigMap using `logstashConfig` in `values.yml` or by environment variables using `extraEnvs` in `values.yml`, however Logstash Docker image can't mix both methods as defining settings with environment variables causes `logstash.yml` to be modified in place while using ConfigMap bind-mount the same file (more details in this [Note](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/6.7/docker-config.html#docker-env-config)).

## Installing

### Using master branch

* Clone the git repo
  ```
  git clone git@github.com:elastic/helm-charts.git
  ```
* Install it
  ```
  helm install --name logstash ./helm-charts/logstash
  ```

## Compatibility

This chart is tested with the latest supported versions. The currently tested versions are:

| 6.x   | 7.x   |
| ----- | ----- |
| 6.8.4 | 7.4.1 |

Examples of installing older major versions can be found in the [examples](./examples) directory.

While only the latest releases are tested, it is possible to easily install old or new releases by overriding the `imageTag`. To install version `7.4.1` of Logstash it would look like this:

```
helm install --name logstash elastic/logstash --set imageTag=7.4.1
```

## Try it out

In [examples/](./examples) you will find some example configurations. These examples are used for the automated testing of this helm chart

### Default

To deploy a cluster with all default values and run the integration tests

```
cd examples/default
make
```

## Testing

This chart uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) to test the templating logic. The dependencies for testing can be installed from the [`requirements.txt`](../requirements.txt) in the parent directory.

```
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
make pytest
```

You can also use `helm template` to look at the YAML being generated

```
make template
```

It is possible to run all of the tests and linting inside of a docker container

```
make test
```

## Integration Testing

Integration tests are run using [goss](https://github.com/aelsabbahy/goss/blob/master/docs/manual.md) which is a serverspec like tool written in golang. See [goss.yaml](examples/default/test/goss.yaml) for an example of what the tests look like.

To run the goss tests against the default example:

```
cd examples/default
make goss
```
