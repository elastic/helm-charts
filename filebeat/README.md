## Requirements

* [Helm][] >=2.8.0 and <3.0.0
* Kubernetes >=1.9

See [supported configurations][] for more details.


## Installing

This chart is tested with 7.8.0 version.

* Add the Elastic Helm charts repo:
`helm repo add elastic https://helm.elastic.co`

* Install 7.8.0 release:
`helm install --name apm-server --version 7.8.0 elastic/filebeat`


## Upgrading

Please always check [CHANGELOG.md][] and [BREAKING_CHANGES.md][] before
upgrading to a new chart version.


## Usage notes

* The default Filebeat configuration file for this chart is configured to use an
Filebeat endpoint. Without any additional changes, Filebeat will send
documents to the service URL that the Filebeat Helm chart sets up by
default. You may either set the `FILEBEAT_HOSTS` environment variable in
`extraEnvs` to override this endpoint or modify the default `filebeatConfig` to
change this behavior.
* The default Filebeat configuration file is also configured to capture
container logs and enrich them with Kubernetes metadata by default. This will
capture all container logs in the cluster.
* This chart disables the [HostNetwork][] setting by default for compatibility
reasons with the majority of kubernetes providers and scenarios. Some kubernetes
providers may not allow enabling `hostNetwork` and deploying multiple Filebeat
pods on the same node isn't possible with `hostNetwork` However Filebeat does
recommend activating it. If your kubernetes provider is compatible with
`hostNetwork` and you don't need to run multiple Filebeat DaemonSets, you can
activate it by setting `hostNetworking: true` in [values.yaml][].
* This repo includes a number of [examples][] configurations which can be used
as a reference. They are also used in the automated testing of this chart.

## FAQ

### How to use Filebeat with Elasticsearch with security (authentication and TLS) enabled?

This Helm chart can use existing [Kubernetes secrets][] to setup
credentials or certificates for examples. These secrets should be created
outside of this chart and accessed using [environment variables][] and volumes.

An example can be found in [examples/security][].

### How to install OSS version of Filebeat?

Deploying OSS version of Elasticsearch can be done by setting `image` value to
[Filebeat OSS Docker image][]

An example of Filebeat deployment using OSS version can be found in
[examples/oss][].

### Why is Filebeat host.name field set to Kubernetes pod name?

The default Filebeat configuration is using Filebeat pod name for
`agent.hostname` and `host.name` fields. The `hostname` of the Kubernetes nodes
can be find in `kubernetes.node.name` field. If you would like to have
`agent.hostname` and `host.name` fields set to the hostname of the nodes, you'll
need to set `daemonset.hostNetworking` value to true.

Note that enabling [hostNetwork][] make Filebeat pod use the host network
namespace which gives it access to the host loopback device, services listening
on localhost, could be used to snoop on network activity of other pods on the
same node.
